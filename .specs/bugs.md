# Bug & Adjustment Tracker

This is the working list of bugs and adjustments found while testing Chronicle. The
product owner reports items as they dogfood the app; entries are added here first, then
attacked in batches when the owner asks. This file is operational (it changes often) —
requirements and design still live in the other specs, and anything here that turns into
a design change must be reflected in the relevant spec and, when substantive, in
`decisions.md`.

## How this file is used

1. **Report** — the owner describes a bug or desired adjustment; it gets an ID and an
   entry under *Open*, with enough context to reproduce or act on it.
2. **Attack** — when the owner says to work the list, items move to *In progress* and
   then to *Resolved*, with the fixing commit referenced.
3. **Roadmap** — if a batch of items suggests re-sequencing or a new milestone task,
   `roadmap.md` is updated in the same change.

## Conventions

- IDs are `B-NNN`, sequential, never reused. Reference them in commits ("Fix B-003: …").
- **Type**: `bug` (behavior is wrong per spec/expectation) or `adjustment` (behavior is
  as designed but should change — UX polish, copy, tuning).
- **Severity** (bugs only): `blocker` / `major` / `minor`.
- **Status**: `Open` → `In progress` → `Fixed` / `Won't fix` / `Duplicate of B-NNN`.
- Dates are absolute (YYYY-MM-DD): reported date and resolved date.
- Resolved entries move to the *Resolved* section (newest first) and keep their full
  entry — the history is part of the value.

## Entry template

```markdown
### B-NNN — short title
- **Type:** bug | adjustment · **Severity:** blocker | major | minor (bugs only)
- **Status:** Open · **Reported:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Area:** feed | player | sync | onboarding | auth | storage | ui-shell | other
- **What happens:** observed behavior (for bugs: steps to reproduce if known).
- **Expected:** what should happen instead (reference spec sections when they exist).
- **Notes:** hypotheses, related decisions (D-NNN), related items (B-NNN).
```

Resolved entries add:

```markdown
- **Resolved:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Commit:** <hash> · **Outcome:** Fixed | Won't fix | Duplicate
- **Resolution:** what was changed, and which specs were updated (if any).
```
